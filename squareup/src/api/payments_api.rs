//! The Payments API lets developers take and manage payments.
//!
//! Applications need the following input to take a payment:
//!
//! * The amount to charge.
//!
//! * The payment recipient. The payment goes to the account identified by the Authorization header
//!   in the API request.
//!
//! * The payment source. The source can be a payment token or card on file.
//!
//! You can generate a payment token using the Web Payments SDK and the In-App Payments SDK. For
//! working code examples, see Square Connect API Examples.
//!
//! A card on file is a credit card, debit card, or gift card that is associated with a customer.
//! You can create a customer and add a card on file using Square APIs, the Square Seller Dashboard, or the Square Point of Sale application.

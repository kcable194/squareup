//! Create and manage invoices.
//!
//! The Invoices API lets you create and manage invoices for orders that were created using the
//! Orders API. After you create the invoice and configure its delivery method, payment schedule,
//! and other invoice settings, you can publish the invoice. Depending on the invoice settings,
//! Square sends the invoice to the customer or automatically charges a card on file. Square also
//! hosts each invoice on a web page where customers can easily pay for it.

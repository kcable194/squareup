//! Get sales data for a Square seller, itemize payments, push orders to POS, and more.
//!
//! The Orders API is your one-stop shop for adding rich functionality to payments. You can itemize
//! payments using custom line items or catalog objects, send orders to physical Point of Sale
//! devices to be fulfilled, attach a customer to a payment, and more.
//!
//! In addition, the Orders API lets you search through all of a seller's past sales and returns
//! itemization data, customer references, and other details from sales made using POS or online.
//!
//! If you use the Square Orders API with a non-Square payments provider, Square charges a
//! transaction fee. For more information, see [Orders API fee
//! structure](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/payments-pricing#orders-api-fee-structure).
